Community Survey Project (CSP) on Unemployment in Nandalagunta, Kovur (M), Nellore (D), AP
As part of my academic journey, I undertook a Community Survey Project aimed at understanding the unemployment landscape in Nandalagunta. This initiative involved extensive research and data collection to identify the factors contributing to unemployment in the region.

To effectively showcase my findings, I developed a comprehensive website and app that serves as a repository for my project work. The platform features:

In-depth analysis of survey data and trends related to unemployment.
Interactive visualizations that present key insights in an easily digestible format.
User-friendly navigation that allows stakeholders to explore findings and recommendations.
This project not only enhanced my technical skills in web and app development but also deepened my understanding of social issues impacting our community. I'm proud to contribute to conversations around unemployment and hope to inspire action towards meaningful solutions.
